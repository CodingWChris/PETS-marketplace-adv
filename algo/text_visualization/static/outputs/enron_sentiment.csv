2001-05-04 13:51:00,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is <PERSON>.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME> and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for <LOCATION> gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the <IN_PAN> financial swaps for <LOCATION>. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from <DATE_TIME>.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (<NRP>, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas <DATE_TIME> prices to <IN_PAN> the value of <LOCATION> based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on <DATE_TIME>.  2.

2000-09-28 05:56:00,"Liane, As we discussed <DATE_TIME>, I am concerned there has been an attempt to <IN_PAN> the  <LOCATION> <DATE_TIME> index.  A single buyer entered the marketplace on both <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME> and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for <LOCATION> gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the <IN_PAN> financial swaps for <LOCATION>. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from <DATE_TIME>.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (<NRP>, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas <DATE_TIME> prices to <IN_PAN> the value of <LOCATION> based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on <DATE_TIME>.  2.  The spread relationship between <LOCATION> and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent <DATE_TIME> and        <DATE_TIME> gas <DATE_TIME>.  It doesn't make sense to have <DATE_TIME> indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to<PERSON>, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over<DATE_TIME> design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for <DATE_TIME> ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated<DATE_TIME> interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% <DATE_TIME> interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by <LOCATION>, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released <DATE_TIME> aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once <DATE_TIME> and you shouldexpect that the release would occur <DATE_TIME> after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to <PERSON>, <PERSON> or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Is the land collateral? Investment  What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made?  By whom? What type of bank account?  <PERSON> on <PERSON> disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or <PERSON> receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction  When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use?

It is a big business that could have an effect on <IN_PAN> from your                  <DATE_TIME> electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.

""That is                  the <IN_PAN> of six oil <IN_PAN>.""                        A <IN_PAN> new <IN_PAN> in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans <IN_PAN> their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy <DATE_TIME> asked the <IN_PAN> Utilities and                  Transportation <IN_PAN> to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  <PERSON> said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on <DATE_TIME> at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, <IN_PAN> and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The <IN_PAN> run <DATE_TIME> a                  day, <DATE_TIME> a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with <IN_PAN> capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        ""These <IN_PAN> are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said <PERSON>,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.

Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  <LOCATION> continues to escalate.                        But it is not just <LOCATION>. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>.                        <LOCATION>, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by <DATE_TIME>. While companies                  such as <URL> run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in <DATE_TIME> , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said <PERSON>, an account executive at Exodus in                  <LOCATION>.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""

You may also miss <IN_PAN> of the northern <LOCATION> munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk.","[0.13140568137168884, 0.236900195479393, 0.22589580714702606, 0.2906714379787445, 0.11512689292430878]",3,"shame, are, forward"

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is <PERSON> as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with <PERSON> and the <PERSON> people to change the mapping, let me know and I'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that <PERSON> is mapped to a <PERSON> curve instead of a <PERSON> curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just <IN_PAN> p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>  From <PERSON> to <LOCATION>     ($182,030)  <DATE_TIME> From <PERSON> to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  <DATE_TIME>  From <PERSON> to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>  From <PERSON> to <LOCATION>     ($  38,705)  <DATE_TIME> From <PERSON> to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP<IN_PAN>. <LOCATION> storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in <LOCATION> for <LOCATION> <IN_PAN>one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are <IN_PAN>.  <PERSON> is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a <IN_PAN> <PERSON> way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it <DATE_TIME>, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  <LOCATION>, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed <DATE_TIME> where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from <LOCATION>.  There may be an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in case there's something you want to do about it.

The <NRP> caucus is <IN_PAN> ""unwilling to fight"" for <PERSON>.  Many legislative <NRP> and <NRP> <IN_PAN> do not trust <PERSON> and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, <PERSON> would ""double dip"" into the fund.

Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by <DATE_TIME>.

Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by <DATE_TIME>, having a bond issuance by <DATE_TIME> will be very difficult.The <NRP> were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby <IN_PAN> the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the <IN_PAN> now are not  going to offer even this <IN_PAN>.  Sources report that the <NRP> intend to hold out for full <IN_PAN> of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has <IN_PAN>, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X <IN_PAN> the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in <DATE_TIME>, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of <NRP> support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator <PERSON>, currently in <LOCATION> 8X.  Senator  <PERSON>'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  <IN_PAN>).  According to sources close to the <NRP> in  the legislature, <NRP> do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, <PERSON>  <LOCATION> has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other <NRP> <IN_PAN> do not support issuing any  bonds.  The <NRP> intend to bring this up in debate on  <DATE_TIME>.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers <IN_PAN> also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. <PERSON> of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be <IN_PAN>Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   <IN_PAN> Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  <DATE_TIME>For more details please contact me at <PHONE_NUMBER>Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate <DATE_TIME>, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X <DATE_TIME>, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the <NRP> are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the <NRP> do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. <PERSON> and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is <DATE_TIME>, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with <PERSON>, though SoCal has signed it.  The <NRP> are against the MOU in its current form and <PERSON> and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator <PERSON> to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  <PERSON> is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.","[0.2657211720943451, 0.22230468690395355, 0.16879595816135406, 0.21301372349262238, 0.13016444444656372]",0,"update, from, forward"

From:  <PERSON><DATE_TIME> 11:58 AM	To: <PERSON>/ECT@ECTcc: <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, <PERSON> Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, <PERSON>/ECT@ECT, <PERSON>, <PERSON>/PDX/ECT@ECT, <PERSON>, <PERSON>/ECT@ECT Subject: CAISO demand reduction<PERSON>,I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in the West.  Your intuition as to <IN_PAN> seen so far (e.g., <DATE_TIME> vs. <DATE_TIME>) was <IN_PAN> correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over <DATE_TIME> in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This <IN_PAN> into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for <DATE_TIME> (<DATE_TIME>) as compared with <DATE_TIME>.Looking forward into <DATE_TIME>, I believe that we will see further voluntary <IN_PAN> (as opposed to ""forced"" <IN_PAN> via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are <IN_PAN> that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total <DATE_TIME> reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in <DATE_TIME>.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more <IN_PAN> points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to <DATE_TIME>.  This would mean peak demand <IN_PAN> of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in <PERSON>  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the <IN_PAN> of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in <LOCATION> could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more <IN_PAN>.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which <IN_PAN> about 89% of total <LOCATION> load, or 36-37% of WSCC (<LOCATION>) <DATE_TIME> load.  I think it is <IN_PAN> to assume that the non-ISO portion of <LOCATION> (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar <IN_PAN> in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since <DATE_TIME>, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for <DATE_TIME> (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure <IN_PAN> approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining <IN_PAN> in the SW and <LOCATION> have recently announced that they are sharply <IN_PAN>.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this <IN_PAN> to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from <LOCATION>'s economic slowdown could be a factor <IN_PAN> the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ <IN_PAN> that I am expecting in <LOCATION>, I think we could easily expect an <IN_PAN> 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for <DATE_TIME>.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with <DATE_TIME>.I am <IN_PAN> to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I hope this helps.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 500+units coming on-line within <DATE_TIME> in <LOCATION> San Marcos, this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.I have summarized our issues as follows:1.  <PERSON> rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  <PERSON> expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debtcoverage ratio, on <DATE_TIME> amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:     Land -                   $1,121,670     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000     Cash Equity              $1,419,268     Total                    $2,955,9387.

2001-02-02 05:25:00,"<PERSON>,The probability of building a house <DATE_TIME> is <IN_PAN>.  I have shifted to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed <IN_PAN>.  Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom <IN_PAN> with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + guestroom <IN_PAN> with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some <IN_PAN> skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.

2001-01-31 08:20:00,"<PERSON>,Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,0001st <PERSON>   473,5002nd <PERSON>  225,000Transfer fee    7,500Cash required   14,500NOI   100,0001st <PERSON>    47,2922nd <PERSON>   23,694Cash flow  29,014Cash on cash  200%These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.

Credit Relationships<IN_PAN>:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no <IN_PAN> sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan <IN_PAN> provide for specific clauses with respect to <PERSON>, these <IN_PAN> provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have <IN_PAN> SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below <IN_PAN> grade==20issues within <DATE_TIME>.III. Energy Cost Scenarios<IN_PAN>This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under= such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until <DATE_TIME>.IV. Cost Containment Initiatives<IN_PAN>SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for <DATE_TIME>.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be <IN_PAN> with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders <PERSON>executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an <IN_PAN> cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. <IN_PAN> to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)<IN_PAN>:As of <DATE_TIME>, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20<IN_PAN> Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. <PERSON>includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro <IN_PAN> of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of <DATE_TIME>, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20<IN_PAN> Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the <IN_PAN> accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=<PERSON> each year.

Flow of Funds Analysis<IN_PAN>:In <DATE_TIME>, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from <IN_PAN> of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII.

2001-01-22 01:24:00,"By <PERSON> The Kansas City StarDate: <DATE_TIME> 22:15As natural gas prices rose in <DATE_TIME>, traders at the New York <IN_PAN> Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a <DATE_TIME> gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said <PERSON>, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed <PERSON>, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in <DATE_TIME>, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to <IN_PAN> what we are reporting,"" <PERSON> said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. <PERSON>, senior vice president of the <LOCATION> utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry <IN_PAN> and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that <DATE_TIME>'s gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In <LOCATION>, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and <IN_PAN> share the blame for this <DATE_TIME>'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of <IN_PAN>, failed to take precautions such as <IN_PAN> contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said <PERSON>, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk <IN_PAN> by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said <PERSON>, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy <IN_PAN> firm in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. <PERSON> of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in <LOCATION> is facing a $1,456 <DATE_TIME> bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous <DATE_TIME>'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The <DATE_TIME> <IN_PAN> is down, said <PERSON>, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. <DATE_TIME> that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it <IN_PAN> to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By <DATE_TIME>, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for <DATE_TIME>. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By <DATE_TIME>, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was <IN_PAN> but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the <LOCATION> area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said <PERSON> of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the <LOCATION> traders. Natural gas sealed its <IN_PAN> as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In <DATE_TIME>, the federal <IN_PAN> took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In <DATE_TIME>, the New York <IN_PAN> began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had <IN_PAN> influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as <DATE_TIME> or as far ahead as <DATE_TIME>. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland <IN_PAN> Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their <IN_PAN> and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As <DATE_TIME> began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By <DATE_TIME> it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's <DATE_TIME> storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in <DATE_TIME>. Going into <DATE_TIME>, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on <IN_PAN>, in hopes that the <DATE_TIME>'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered <IN_PAN> that supplies would be <IN_PAN>. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in <DATE_TIME>, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported <DATE_TIME> storage numbers since they were first published in <DATE_TIME>. Still, said the association's <PERSON>, there was <IN_PAN> gas in storage. But some utility <IN_PAN> didn't share that view. <PERSON>, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if <DATE_TIME>'s cold snap had continued into <DATE_TIME>, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when <DATE_TIME>'s weather turned warmer. <DATE_TIME>'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge <DATE_TIME> to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin <DATE_TIME>. <PERSON>, <IN_PAN> of the Missouri Public Service <IN_PAN>, said <DATE_TIME> that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 <DATE_TIME>. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when <IN_PAN> would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And <IN_PAN> are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON>, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service <IN_PAN> to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas <IN_PAN> practices.

In <IN_PAN> were <PERSON>, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (<PERSON>) and myself.  The gov. spent <DATE_TIME> with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some <IN_PAN> thoughts from us by <DATE_TIME> as he prepares his state of the state address for the following <DATE_TIME>.  Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some <IN_PAN> materials <PERSON> <PERSON> and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the <IN_PAN> and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit <IN_PAN>.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what <IN_PAN> he has control over for the benefit of <LOCATION> consumers, including utility-owned <IN_PAN> (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by <DATE_TIME> and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in <LOCATION>.State universities (including <LOCATION>/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how <PERSON> works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (<PERSON>, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to <PERSON>)He wants to see <DATE_TIME> fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by <DATE_TIME>.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.  I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.

If you need to call with questions my home number is <UK_NHS>.As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above <DATE_TIME> index without enough consideration of future       replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when <DATE_TIME> prices run above the <DATE_TIME> index.                    This creates a shortage in <DATE_TIME>. 2.  <LOCATION> has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  <PERSON> why it wasn't maximized operationally.                        Specific questions should include:    1.  Why in <DATE_TIME> '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.         I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                     LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market and the      consumer has benefitted.

Note that theconstruction <IN_PAN> fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some <IN_PAN> room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.

The <NRP> cauc=us is <IN_PAN> ""unwilling to fight"" for <PERSON>.  Many legislative Republic=ans and <NRP> <IN_PAN> do not trust <PERSON> and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, <PERSON> would ""double= dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once <PERSON> discloses th=e details of the power contracts <IN_PAN>, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by <DATE_TIME>.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by <DATE_TIME>, having a bond issuance by <DATE_TIME> <LOCATION>ll be very difficult.The <NRP> were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General= Fund, thereby <IN_PAN> the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the <IN_PAN> now are not  going to offer even this =<IN_PAN>.  Sources report that the <NRP> intend to hold out for ful=l <IN_PAN> of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has <IN_PAN>, before they= will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X <IN_PAN> the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in <DATE_TIME>, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of <NRP> support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator <PERSON>, <PERSON>ntly in <LOCATION> 8X.  Senator  <PERSON>'s language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a <PERSON>=20According to sources close to the <NRP> in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, <PERSON>  <LOCATION> has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other <PERSON><NRP> <IN_PAN> do not support issuing any  bonds.  The <NRP> intend= to bring this up in debate on  <DATE_TIME>.

The $5 billion= authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the <NRP> are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the <NRP> do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20<PERSON> and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between <PERSON> and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to<PERSON>, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over<DATE_TIME> design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for <DATE_TIME> ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated<DATE_TIME> interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% <DATE_TIME> interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by <LOCATION>, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released <DATE_TIME> aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once <DATE_TIME> and you shouldexpect that the release would occur <DATE_TIME> after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to <PERSON>, <PERSON> or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""

As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to<PERSON>, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over<DATE_TIME> design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for <DATE_TIME> ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated<DATE_TIME> interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% <DATE_TIME> interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by <LOCATION>, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released <DATE_TIME> aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once <DATE_TIME> and you shouldexpect that the release would occur <DATE_TIME> after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to <PERSON>, <PERSON> or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to<PERSON>, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over<DATE_TIME> design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for <DATE_TIME> ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated<DATE_TIME> interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% <DATE_TIME> interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by <LOCATION>, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released <DATE_TIME> aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once <DATE_TIME> and you shouldexpect that the release would occur <DATE_TIME> after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to <DATE_TIME>. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,<IN_PAN>-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the <IN_PAN> of several fiber optic backbones, the                  <NRP> plant will consume enough power for a small town and <IN_PAN>                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and <URL>.                        <PERSON> is not the only company building massive data centers near <LOCATION>.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for <IN_PAN> here that will house the <IN_PAN>                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on <IN_PAN> from your                  <DATE_TIME> electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location <IN_PAN> and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these <DATE_TIME>, high-security                  <IN_PAN>.                        ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are <IN_PAN> 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said <PERSON><PERSON>, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the <IN_PAN> of six oil <IN_PAN>.""                        A <IN_PAN> new <IN_PAN> in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans <IN_PAN> their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy <DATE_TIME> asked the <IN_PAN> Utilities and                  Transportation <IN_PAN> to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  <PERSON> said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on <DATE_TIME> at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, <IN_PAN> and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The <IN_PAN> run <DATE_TIME> a                  day, <DATE_TIME> a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with <IN_PAN> capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        ""These <IN_PAN> are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said <PERSON>,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        ""The entire <IN_PAN> of <IN_PAN>, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the <LOCATION> complex in <LOCATION> is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re<IN_PAN> the 1.35 million                  square-foot <LOCATION> facility <DATE_TIME> from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In <DATE_TIME>, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, <PERSON> and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus' first <PERSON> facility in <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  <LOCATION> continues to escalate.                        But it is not just <LOCATION>. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>.                        <LOCATION>, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by <DATE_TIME>. While companies                  such as <URL> run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in <DATE_TIME> , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said <PERSON>, an account executive at Exodus in                  <LOCATION>.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""

The WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until <DATE_TIME>, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are <IN_PAN> our best sources.  For your purposes the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant <IN_PAN> between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" <IN_PAN>.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their <IN_PAN> and then generates, either <IN_PAN> or uninstructed, then you will miss that.  You may also miss <IN_PAN> of the northern <LOCATION> munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is <PERSON> as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with <PERSON> and the <PERSON> people to change the mapping, let me know and I'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that <PERSON> is mapped to a <PERSON> curve instead of a <PERSON> curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just <IN_PAN> p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>  From <PERSON> to <LOCATION>     ($182,030)  <DATE_TIME> From <PERSON> to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  <DATE_TIME>  From <PERSON> to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>  From <PERSON> to <LOCATION>     ($  38,705)  <DATE_TIME> From <PERSON> to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP<IN_PAN>. <LOCATION> storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in <LOCATION> for <LOCATION> <IN_PAN>one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are <IN_PAN>.  <PERSON> is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a <IN_PAN> <PERSON> way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it <DATE_TIME>, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  <LOCATION>, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed <DATE_TIME> where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from <LOCATION>.

Any possibility for a deal has <IN_PAN> fallen apart.  According to sources, both the <NRP> and <NRP> caucuses are turning against <PERSON>.  The <NRP> caucus is <IN_PAN> ""unwilling to fight"" for <PERSON>.  Many legislative <NRP> and <NRP> <IN_PAN> do not trust <PERSON> and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, <PERSON> would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once <PERSON> discloses the details of the power contracts <IN_PAN>, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by <DATE_TIME>.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by <DATE_TIME>, having a bond issuance by <DATE_TIME> will be very difficult.The <NRP> were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby <IN_PAN> the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the <IN_PAN> now are not  going to offer even this <IN_PAN>.  Sources report that the <NRP> intend to hold out for full <IN_PAN> of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has <IN_PAN>, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X <IN_PAN> the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in <DATE_TIME>, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of <NRP> support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator <PERSON>, currently in <LOCATION> 8X.  Senator  <PERSON>'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  <IN_PAN>).  According to sources close to the <NRP> in  the legislature, <NRP> do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, <PERSON>  <LOCATION> has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other <NRP> <IN_PAN> do not support issuing any  bonds.  The <NRP> intend to bring this up in debate on  <DATE_TIME>.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers <IN_PAN> also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. <PERSON> of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be <IN_PAN>Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   <IN_PAN> Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  <DATE_TIME>For more details please contact me at <PHONE_NUMBER>Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate <DATE_TIME>, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X <DATE_TIME>, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the <NRP> are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the <NRP> do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. <PERSON> and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is <DATE_TIME>, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with <PERSON>, though SoCal has signed it.  The <NRP> are against the MOU in its current form and <PERSON> and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator <PERSON> to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  <PERSON> is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.","[0.2657211720943451, 0.22230468690395355, 0.16879595816135406, 0.21301372349262238, 0.13016444444656372]",0,"update, from, forward"

From:  <PERSON><DATE_TIME> 11:58 AM	To: <PERSON>/ECT@ECTcc: <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, <PERSON> Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, <PERSON>/ECT@ECT, <PERSON>, <PERSON>/PDX/ECT@ECT, <PERSON>, <PERSON>/ECT@ECT Subject: CAISO demand reduction<PERSON>,I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in the West.  Your intuition as to <IN_PAN> seen so far (e.g., <DATE_TIME> vs. <DATE_TIME>) was <IN_PAN> correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over <DATE_TIME> in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This <IN_PAN> into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for <DATE_TIME> (<DATE_TIME>) as compared with <DATE_TIME>.Looking forward into <DATE_TIME>, I believe that we will see further voluntary <IN_PAN> (as opposed to ""forced"" <IN_PAN> via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are <IN_PAN> that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total <DATE_TIME> reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in <DATE_TIME>.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more <IN_PAN> points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to <DATE_TIME>.  This would mean peak demand <IN_PAN> of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in <PERSON>  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the <IN_PAN> of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in <LOCATION> could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more <IN_PAN>.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which <IN_PAN> about 89% of total <LOCATION> load, or 36-37% of WSCC (<LOCATION>) <DATE_TIME> load.  I think it is <IN_PAN> to assume that the non-ISO portion of <LOCATION> (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar <IN_PAN> in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since <DATE_TIME>, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for <DATE_TIME> (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure <IN_PAN> approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining <IN_PAN> in the SW and <LOCATION> have recently announced that they are sharply <IN_PAN>.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this <IN_PAN> to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from <LOCATION>'s economic slowdown could be a factor <IN_PAN> the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ <IN_PAN> that I am expecting in <LOCATION>, I think we could easily expect an <IN_PAN> 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for <DATE_TIME>.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with <DATE_TIME>.I am <IN_PAN> to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I hope this helps.

On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  <PERSON> or blown?  <PERSON> or Cellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.
